This dataset contains informative data from countries across the globe about the prevalence of  mental health disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety  disorders, drug use disorders, depression and alcohol use disorders.
By providing this data in an 
easy to visualise format you can gain an insight into how these issues are impacting lives; allowing

Through this reflection you may be able to answer some important questions: 
 What are the types of mental health disorder that people around the world suffer? 
 How many people in each country suffer mental health problems? 
 Are men or women more likely to have depression? 
 Is depression linked with suicide and what is the percentage rate? 
 In which age groups is depression more common? 

From exploring patterns between prevalence rates through in-depth data visualisation you’ll be 
able to further understand these complex issues. The knowledge gained from this dataset can 
help bring valuable decision making skills such as research grants, policy making or preventative 
intervention plans across various countries.
